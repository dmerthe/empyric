# Basic format of a runcard that describes an experiment using the empyric library.
# Any keys that include "Name" are completely arbitrary; they are only used for reference internally and in the GUI.
# It is good practice to give unique and sensible names to all instruments, variables, alarms, plots and routines.

Description:
 name:  # name of experiment
 operator:  # name of person running experiment
 platform:  # location of experiment
 comments: # any additional useful information about the experiment

Settings:
 follow-up: # runcard of experiment, if any, that comes after this one
 step interval: # minimum time between steps in the experiment
 plot interval: # minimum time between generation of plots, specified in the Plots section below
 save interval: # minimum time between data saves
 async: # whether to loop through variables and routines asynchronously or not

Instruments:
 Instrument Name:
  type: # class of instrument from the instruments module
  address:  # unique address of the instrument
  presets:  # instrument knobs can be set before the experiment starts, usually for safety purposes
   knob: # preset value for knob
  postsets:  # instruments knobs can be set after the experiment finishes, too
   knob:  # postset value for knob

Variables:  # There are three types of variables:
 Knob Variable Name:
  instrument: # name of instrument that controls the variable
  knob: # knob associated with the variable
 Meter Variable Name:
  instrument:  # name of instrument that controls the variable
  meter:  # meter associated with the variable
 Expression Variable Name:
  expression: # mathematical expression of the variable in terms of above variables
  definitions:  # dictionary mapping symbols in the above expression to the names of variables above

Alarms:
 Alarm Name:
  condition:  # condition in which alarm is triggered, expressed in terms of variables defined above
  definitions: # map of symbols in condition to variables, of the form {..., symbol: variable name, ...}
  protocol: # what to do when alarm is triggered

Plots:
 Plot Name:
  x:  # abcissa of the plot
  y:  # ordinate(s) of the plot
  xlabel:  # label for the x-axis
  ylabel: # label for the y-axis
  style:  # the kind of plot, e.g. 'log' or 'parametric'
  marker:  # marker symbol(s) for points on the plot

Routines:
 Routine Name:
  type:  # class of experimental routine
  knobs: # name(s) of knob(s) to be modulated
  meters:  # if required, name(s) of meter(s) to use for feedback
  times:  # list (or array) of times when changes to the knobs are made
  values:  # list (array) of values that are assigned to the knob(s)
