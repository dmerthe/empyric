- Figure out how to access files/data while in use
- Testing and development for more robust alarm behavior
- Split out different modes of GPIB adapters (e.g. NationalInstrumentsGPIBUSB, PrologixGPIBUSB, Prologix GPIBLAN)
   - Would need distinct address patterns
   - Might as well explicitly specify address patterns for all adapters
- Change PrologixGPIBUSB backend to PyVISA
